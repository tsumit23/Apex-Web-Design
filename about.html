            <p>Whether you’re a small business owner thinking about a new website, a web veteran in need of a trendy redesign, a digital marketing agency wanting to take their website to the next level or a student with a passing interest in web design, you’re more than likely going to seek some inspiration to kick start your web design project.</p>
            <p>At Apex Web Design, we always look for new and inspiring ways to deliver client websites. Whilst some sites require very little ‘frilly stuff’ (which is an actual term a client of ours uses) we like to push boundaries wherever possible. This could be something as simple as a unique font or floating image boxes but we believe it’s important that, as well as delivering the best product possible for our clients, our own team can be proud of the work they’ve done.</p>
            <p>Founded in 2009, we are a bootstrapped and profitable company helping design talent share, grow, and get hired by over 40,000 of today’s most innovative brands around the world.</p>
